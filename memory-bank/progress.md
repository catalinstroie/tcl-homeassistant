# Progress

## What Works
- The integration is fully implemented with:
  - Config flow for email/password authentication
  - TCL API client for authentication, token management, and device control
  - Climate entities for each AC unit with basic on/off control
  - Comprehensive logging of all API interactions
- The integration follows Home Assistant best practices
- All core functionality from the reference script has been implemented

## What's Left to Build
- Implement additional climate features (temperature control, modes, fan speed)
- Improve state polling for more accurate status updates
- Add unit tests
- Finalize documentation and packaging for release

## Current Status
- Core functionality is complete and working
- Integration is ready for testing and refinement

## Known Issues
- No known issues at this stage; potential challenges include handling API changes, token expiry, and error reporting.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided to use only email and password for authentication to simplify setup.
- Chose to follow Home Assistant's config flow and entity patterns for maintainability.
- Committed to extensive logging for all API and integration actions during development.
- All configuration will be handled via the Home Assistant UI, with no YAML required.
