# TCL AC Integration - Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic authentication working
- ✅ Device discovery implemented
- ✅ On/off control functional
- ✅ Climate platform integration complete
- ❌ Temperature control not implemented
- ❌ Fan speed control not implemented
- ❌ Advanced state polling needed

## Known Issues
1. No temperature control capability
2. Limited state polling (relies on last command)
3. No error recovery for expired tokens
4. AWS IoT control could be more robust

## Completed Features
- Multi-step authentication flow
- Device discovery and listing
- Basic climate entity implementation
- Config flow with email/password
- Error handling for common cases

## Roadmap
1. Add temperature control (next priority)
2. Implement fan speed control
3. Add proper state polling
4. Implement token refresh/recovery
5. Add more HVAC modes (heat, dry, etc.)
